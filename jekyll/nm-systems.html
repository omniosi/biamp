			<h1>NETWORKED MEDIA SYSTEMS</h1>
			<h2>What Is A Networked Media System?</h2>
			<p class="em">A Networked Media System is any audio and/or video equipment that communicates over an organization&rsquo;s Ethernet network. Networked Media Systems are designed to maximize system resources while simplifying system administration.</p>
			<p class="em">Networked Media Systems can support multiple types of solutions simultaneously. For example, a facility could have paging throughout a floor or building, conferencing in the meeting rooms, and sound reinforcement in the auditorium, all operating simultaneously and running on the corporate network. NMS leverages your existing network infrastructure, which results in a superior audio experience.</p>

		<h1>CONFIGURATIONS</h1>

				<h2>Centralized NMS</h2>
				<p>Centralized Networked Media Systems are designed to be cost effective, efficient, and scalable. With a centralized system, all of the DSP is in one physical location, such as a central AV rack or a server room. Housing the DSP in an unoccupied space makes maintenance easier and upgrades less time consuming. Expansion into new areas is also simplified by the need to install I/O endpoints only. Biamp’s Tesira family excels in centralized Networked Media Systems.</p>

				<h2>Decentrailzed NMS</h2>
				<p>A decentralized Networked Media System, like Biamp’s Vocia<span class="super">®</span> family, places DSP at all of the endpoints, and distributes the demand for DSP across the network, sharing resources between devices as needed rather than routing all signals through a single point, which means there’s no single point of potential system failure. The decentralized model is zone-based, and each zone can be optimized for different scenarios – background music, paging, or even sound reinforcement - resulting in a more efficient system with nearly limitless possibilities.</p>

			<h2>CONFERENCING</h2>
			<p>A good conferencing solution is vital to every company, regardless of its size. Networked Media Systems can be integrated with a company’s VoIP system, providing additional signal processing to deliver crisp, echo-free audio every time. If a company is using soft codecs like Lync® or Skype™, a laptop can be connected to our USB interface in plug-and-play fashion, making it easy to enhance the audio of your conversations.</p>

				<h2>PAGING</h2>
				<p>Paging or mass notification is a requirement for most public buildings, and Networked Media Systems are excellent for this application. Instead of resorting to the obsolete and distracting “all call” approach, you can use zoned paging to broadcast messages only to those who need to hear them. Integrating paging with ambient noise compensation allows the paging volume to adjust up or down automatically according to the space’s ambient volume. This ensures pages are always audible and intelligible – which is crucial in times of emergency – without being overly loud.</p>

				<h2>SOUND REINFORCEMENT</h2>
				<p>With sound reinforcement, there remains a great deal of art mixed with science in implementing robust audio solutions. In many cases, the space can be acoustically challenging, with multiple reflective surfaces or constraints on microphone and speaker placement for architectural reasons. Other applications, like a panel conference, require a large number of microphones. Networked Media Systems are well-suited for sound reinforcement applications for a number of reasons. Because they’re Ethernet-based, only one cable is required for both control signals and audio transport, minimizing the number of cable runs required, which is advantageous for historic venues and retro-fits. Advanced software capabilities, like dynamic processing and auto mixers, function like an autopilot for your audio system, eliminating the need for manual adjustment of room levels.</p>
